<p class="personal">  I'm Richard, born in 1963 (yes, I'm that old), near Kingston Ontario. I went to school in Brockville, Kingston, Boston and Zurich. I'm an electrical engineer, but have spent much of that time creating software, hardware and firmware/embedded systems. My specialty is industrial ultrasound for which I have a patent as a research scientist at Western U in London Ontario (the other London). I am self-employed as a developer/engineer. I speak English, a bit of Dutch, and have high school French which lets me just get by. My passion is sailing. I spent my life sailing everything from windsurfers competitively to motor-sailers. Thanks...
